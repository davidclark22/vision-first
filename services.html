                    <p>It is always recommended that patients are seen for an annual comprehensive eye exam. It is important to have your eyes evaluated annually, because your eyes can be the first key to detecting other systemic problems. We are able to offer visual field testing which can help to diagnose glaucoma, strokes, tumors, or optic nerve or macula irregularities. We are also able to perform retinal photography which allows us to closely monitor glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, and many more retinal conditions.</p>
